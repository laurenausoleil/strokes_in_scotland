# Assumptions

Data joined by approximate year where discreopancies in financial year and calendar year.

EASR and crude rate in mortality refer to mortality per 100,000 and in hospital stays refer to hospital stays per 100,000 
(https://www.scotpho.org.uk/health-wellbeing-and-disease/stroke/data/scottish-data/)

Qualifiers removed, but could be used for extension work.

Losing detail of age groupings from hospital stays will not affect analysis /
The larger age groupings will allow for a broader, but easier to interpret analysis.

Use EASR whenever available to normalise rates by European standards.
Order of preference for adjusted metrics: EASR, SMR, crude.

Use mean as standard method of assimilating rates in order to visualise differences in demographics more clearly.
