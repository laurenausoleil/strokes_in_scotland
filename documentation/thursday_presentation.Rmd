## Aim

**How can Scottish health services most effectively prevent and treat stroke diagnoses?**

This project examines data on stroke diagnosis in Scotland to inform decision making on stroke care and intervention for public health bodies.

***

## Background

* Stroke is a disease of the cerebrovascular system, the system which supplies blood to the brain.
* Cerebrovascular disease include stroke, Subarachnoid Haemorhage or Transient Ischemic Attacks (commonly known as mini-strokes).
* The treatment and prevention of stroke is a national clinical priority for Scotland
* Scotland has launched major stroke care plans in 2009 and 2014.

***

## Data and Methodology

* This project uses publicly available published by Public Health Scotland
* Available data covers the years 2009-2018
* The data includes information on hospital activity (stays and  discharges), mortality rates and incidence rates.
* Demographic detail varies by dataset and include age, gender, Council Area or Health Board and SIMD (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation)
* Data is cleaned, analysed and presented in R using Rstudio and Tidyverse.

### Age

```{r}
council_strokesbyca %>% 
# filter year to remove high values from years prior to 2013 in order to make graph more readable
  filter(approx_year > 2013) %>% 
  filter(diagnosis != "TIAs and related syndromes") %>% 
  group_by(age_group, approx_year, diagnosis) %>% 
  summarise(mortality = mean(easr_mortality, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = approx_year, y = mortality, group = diagnosis, col = diagnosis) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~age_group) +
  labs(
    title = "Mortality by age and diagnosis over time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Mortality (EASR)",
    col = "Diagnosis"
  ) +
  scale_color_calc()
```

* Cardiovascular Disease is the biggest killer per 100 discharges from hospital followed by Stroke and Subarachnoid Haemorhage.
* Mortality rates have fallen for the 75+ group with Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke.
* Mortality rates have remained static for all other age and diagnosis groupings.
* Slightly higher mortality from stroke in Shetland vs normal distribution of deaths per diagnosis.

***
### Age and Gender

```{r}
council_strokesbyca %>% 
  group_by(sex, age_group, diagnosis) %>%
  summarise(mortality = mean(easr_mortality, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    aes(x = age_group, y = mortality, group = diagnosis, fill = diagnosis) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of mortalities by age, diagnosis and gender",
    x = "Age Group",
    y = "Mortality (EASR)",
    fill = "Diagnosis"
  )  +
  scale_fill_calc()
```

* Younger women with Subarachnoid Haemorhage are dying more often from Subarachnoid Haemorhage than males.
* Men in the 45-64 age group are more likely to die from stroke.

***
### Gender

```{r}
council_strokesbyca %>% 
  filter(diagnosis != "TIAs and related syndromes") %>% 
  group_by(sex, diagnosis) %>%
  summarise(mortality = mean(easr_mortality, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    aes(x = diagnosis, y = mortality, group = sex, fill = sex) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of mortalities for each diagnosis",
    subtitle = "Separated by gender",
    x = "Diagnosis",
    y = "Mortality (EASR)",
    fill = "Gender"
  ) +
  scale_fill_calc()
```

* Women die from Subarachnoid Haemorhage proportionally more than men.

***



### Gender

```{r}
incidence_by_hb %>% 
  group_by(sex, year) %>% 
  summarise(incidence = mean(easr, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = year, y = incidence, group = sex, col = sex) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Incidents by Gender 2009-2018",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Incidents (EASR)",
    col = "Gender"
  ) +
  scale_color_calc()
```
  
* Men have higher rates of incidence than women.
* All genders trending in decrease of incidents.
* Female incidence rates are the most volatile.
* Female incidents rising since 2016.
* Mortality does not vary significantly with gender
* Although men have higher incidence rates than women, they have similar levels of mortality. i.e. more women die per episode of stroke diagnosis than men.

### Age

```{r}
council_strokesbyca %>%
  group_by(age_group, diagnosis) %>%
  summarise(mortality = mean(easr_mortality, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    aes(x = age_group, y = mortality, group = diagnosis, fill = diagnosis) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of mortalities by diagnoses and age group",
    x = "Age Group",
    y = "Mortality (EASR)",
    fill = "Diagnosis"
  ) +
  scale_fill_calc()
```

* Stroke discharges increase with age group, but account for a consistent proportion of mortality across all age groups.
* Cardiovascular Disease is the most common diagnosis for all age groups.
* Cardiovascular Disease is the highest killer for all age groups and proportion of death by Cardiovascular Disease increases with age.
* Subarachnoid Haemorhage causes a higher proportion of fatalities in younger age groups than in older age groups.

healthboard_strokesbyhb %>%
  group_by(age_group, sex) %>% 
  summarise(mortality = mean(easr_mortality, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  inner_join(percent_table) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = age_group, y = mortality / incidence * 100, group = sex, fill = sex) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +

    title = "Deaths per 100 incidents",
    subtitle = "Grouped by age and gender",
    x = "Age group",
    y = "Rate of Mortality by Incident (%)",
    fill = "Gender"
  ) +
  scale_fill_calc()
```

* Men have slightly higher mortality rates for all age groups under 74.
* For the 75+ group, women have the highest mortality.
* Men have the highest incidence rates for all age groups.
* From 45 years upwards, women have the highest number of deaths per incident. 
* From 0-44 years males have the highest number of deaths per incident

### Healthboard

```{r}
healthboard_table <- healthboard_strokesbyhb %>% 
  group_by(healthboard_area_named) %>% 
  summarise(mortality = mean(easr_mortality, na.rm = TRUE)) 

healthboard_table <- incidence_by_hb %>%

  summarise(incidence = mean(easr, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(health_board = if_else(
    str_detect(health_board, "NHS"),
    str_sub(health_board, start = 5, end = -1),
    health_board
    )
  ) %>% 
  full_join(healthboard_table, by = c("health_board" = "healthboard_area_named")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(incidence))
  
healthboard_table %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = incidence, y = mortality)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, colour = "navy") +
  geom_text(aes(label = health_board), hjust = -.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Mortalities per incident by Health Board",
    x = "Number of Incidents (EASR)",
    y = "Number of Mortalities (EASR)"
  )
```

* No significant differences in mortality by health boards (maximum of 12.5 deaths per 100,000 population adjusted).
* Differences in number of incidents by health board of up 100 cases per 100,000 (adjusted) between different healthboards.
* Higher mortalities per incidence in Lanarkshire, Highlands, Grampian and Western Isles.
* Lower mortalities per incidence in the Borders, Tayside, Lothian and Fife.

  ) +
  scale_color_calc()
```

* There is a difference in stroke mortality of up to 25 per 100,000 between different council areas. 
* Highest adjusted mortality in Inverclyde and Renfrewshire.
* Lowest adjusted mortality rates in East Renfrewshire and East Dunbartonshire.
* The 10 councils with the highest recent mortality rates showed increase in adjusted mortality in 2013, 2015 and 2018 with an overall downward trend.
* The 10 councils with the lowest recent mortality rates show much more stable decline excluding a rise in mortalities in 2013.

### SIMD


```{r}
discharges_bysimd %>% 
  mutate(approx_year = as.character(approx_year)) %>% 
  group_by(deprivation_quintile, approx_year) %>% 
  summarise(avg_discharges = mean(easr_discharge, na.rm = T)) %>%

  labs(
    title = "Hospital activity by SIMD quintile over time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Discharges (EASR)",
    col = "SIMD Quintile"
  )
```

* Hospital activity increases with deprivation.
* Difference between hospital activity rates for deprivation quintiles is increasing over time, particularly for the 2 most deprived quintiles.
***

#### Table showing standardised mortality rates by SIMD decile
```{r}
knitr::kable(mortality_bysimd %>% 
  group_by(simd_decile) %>% 
  summarise(mortality = mean(smr_mortality)) %>% 
  rename("Decile" = "simd_decile",
         "Mortality (SMR)" = "mortality")
)
```

* Mortalities increase with deprivation.
* Chance of dying from stroke doubles from the least to the most deprived deciles.

***

### SIMD
### Age Group and SIMD

```{r}
mortality_bysimd %>% 
  group_by(simd_decile, age_group) %>% 
  filter(age_group != "All") %>% 
  summarise(avg_mortality = mean(smr_mortality, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = simd_decile, y = avg_mortality, group = age_group, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Adjusted stroke mortality rates by SIMD",
    x = "SIMD Decile",
    y = "Mortality (SMR)",
    fill = "Age Group"
  ) +
  scale_fill_calc()
```

* Mortality is higher for those in the most deprived decile.
* SIMD has the highest impact on mortality for the under 65 age group. 
* 189.5 people per 100,000 under 65 (adjusted) die of strokes in the most deprived decile, compared to just 42.3 of those in the least deprived decile.

## What measures have been successful in the treatment and prevention of stroke?

Direct answer unavailable in the available data, but promising directions found:

* Research interventions that have targetted the 75+ age group, particularly with Stroke and Cardiovascular Disease
* Research dissemination and implementation of the 2009 and 2014 stroke action plans, particularly focussing on changes in treatment and intervention at council level.
* Explore the impact of council policies and politics on health measures.

***

## Which demographics should we target for stroke intervention?

* Focus efforts on Cardiovascular Disease
* Targetted interventions for women and younger people in deprived areas.
* Publicise strok symptoms with an emphasis on women's symptoms to encourage hospital attendance

In future:
* Model social factors which contribute to stroke incidence and mortality in women, such as smoking, high blood pressure, caring duties, mental wellbeing.
* Compare diagnosis rates on presentation and discharge hospital to identify whether misdiagnosis of Subarachnoid Haemorhage is more common in women or younger age groups.
* Conduct research on the understanding and identification of Subarachnoid Haemorhage in women.
