What is the most common stroke diagnosis in Scotland?
analysis_q1_q2/Average rates for hospital stays, discharges and deaths by healthboard 
----

CD is the most common diagnosis, measured by EASR of hospital discharges, with 479 per 100,000. Followed by Stroke (332), TIAs(64) and SH (19).

----
Are there any differences when we look at the data by health board vs by local authority?
analysis_q1_q2/difference in stay rates
analysis_q1_q2/difference in mortalities
analysis_q1_q2/difference in discharges
----

No significant differences. Greatest difference is in discharges rates in Glasgow with a difference of 30 discharges per 100,000 population.

----
Are there any differences in stroke metrics between different demographics (e.g. sex, age group)?

# Gender
analysis_bydemographic/gender/diagnosis
  Women die from SH proportionally more than men.
  
analysis_bydemographic/gender/incidence
  Men have higher rates of incidence than women and other genders
  
analysis_bydemographic/gender/gender incidence over time
With mean:
  All groups trending in decrease, with female incidence rates being the most volatile.
  Female incidents rising since 2016, all genders slightly increasing since 2016.
With median: 
  Most significant decrease in 2010, then no significant change. 
  Fluctuation 2010-2014, stasis or increase 2014-2018.
  
analysis_bydemographic/gender/Gender mortality over time
  Mortalities for male have outstripped females in 2013, 2016 and 2018.
  All mortality rates declining.
  Mortality rates for the most recent figures showed male with highest mortalities
  
# Age

analysis_bydemographic/age/mortality
  Most deaths in 75 plus age group (435 deaths per 100,000 EASR), followed by 65-74 group (57), 45-64 (11) then 0-44 (1).
  
analysis_bydemographic/age/Trends in age group diagnoses over time/mortality
  No upwards trends in mortality by stroke.
  Mortality has decreased significantly for the over 75 group and remained static for all other age groups.
  
analysis_bydemographic/age/diagnosis/mortality
  Stroke accounts for consistent proportion of mortalities across all age groups.
  CD is the highest killer for all age groups and proportion of death by CD increases with age.
  Proportion of death by SH decreases with age group.
  
analysis_bydemographic/age/diagnosis/discharges
  Stroke discharges increase with age group.
  CD is the most common diagnosis and accounts for consistent proportion of discharges across all age groups.
  Proportion of SH hospital activity decreases with age group
  
analysis_bydemographic/age/diagnosis/Ratio activity to deaths
  Percentage of deaths by hospital activity increases with age group.
  SH is the most fatal diagnosis for all groups under 75 years.
  Death by stroke does not increase as significantly for stroke diagnosis in the 75 plus age group as it does for all other age groups.
  
analysis_bydemographic/age/diagnosis/Mortality by age and diagnosis over time
  We see decrease in mortalities for the 75 plus age group with CD and stroke, but not SH.     All other age groups have consistent mortality rates for all diagnoses.
  
# Gender and Age

analysis_bydemographic/gender and age/mortality
  Men have slightly higher mortality rates for all age groups under 74.
  For the 75+ group, women have the highest mortality.

analysis_bydemographic/gender and age/incidence
  Men have the highest incidence rates for all age groups.
  
analysis_bydemographic/gender and age/Percent death by incidence by age and gender
  From 45 years upwards, women have the highest number of deaths per incident. 
  From 0-44 years males have the highest number of deaths per incident
  
analysis_bydemographic/gender and age/Mortality by Diagnosis
  Younger women with SH, especially the 45-64 age group, are dying more often from SH than male and all genders.
  Men in the 45-64 age group are more likely to die from stroke.
  
# Healthboard

analysis_bydemographic/healthboard/mortality
  Differences between health boards of 12.5 deaths per 100,000 population (adjusted).

analysis_bydemographic/healthboard/incidence
  Differences of up to 100 cases per 100,000 (adjusted) between different healthboards.
  Greater Glasgow & Clyde have the highest incidences and Orkney has the lowest numbers.

analysis_bydemographic/healthboard/incidence mortality
  Higher mortalities per incidence in Lanarkshire, Highlands, Grampian and Western Isles.
  Lower mortalities per incidence in the Borders, Tayside, Lothian and Fife.

analysis_bydemographic/healthboard/diagnosis
  Slightly higher mortality from stroke in Shetland vs normal distribution of deaths per diagnosis.

# Council

Unable to explore incidence rates by council area.

analysis_bydemographic/council/mortality
  These adjusted mortality rates show that there is a difference in stroke mortality between different council areas. 
  Highest adjusted mortality in Inverclyde and Renfrewshire.
  Lowest adjusted mortality rates in East Renfrewshire and East Dunbartonshire.

analysis_bydemographic/council/Council mortality rates over time for highest and lowest mortality rate councils/10 highest and lowest all time mortality rates, mean
  Greatest divergences in 2010 and 2015.
  Note that these are the years after the two government strategies published.
  
analysis_bydemographic/council/Council mortality rates over time for highest and lowest mortality rate councils/10 highest and lowest mortality councils in 2018, Mean 
  The 10 councils with the highest recent mortality rates showed increase in adjusted mortality in 2013, 2015 and 2018 with an overall downward trend.
  The 10 councils with the lowest recent mortality rates show much more stable decline excluding a rise in mortalities in 2013.
  
analysis_bydemographic/council/Council mortality rates over time for highest and lowest mortality rate councils/10 highest and lowest all time mortality rates, Median
  Downward trend in mortalities for both groupings, with all time highest mortality councils decreasing more significantly than lowest.
  Seeing greatest divergence in 2011 and 2016.
  Looking at small differences here of around 5 deaths per 100,000.
  
# SIMD

analysis_bysimd/discharges
  More hospital activity with higher deprivation.
  
analysis_bysimd/discharges over time
  Difference between hospital activity rates for deprivation quintiles is increasing over time, particularly for the 2 most deprived quintiles.

analysis_bysimd/mortality
  Mortalities increase with deprivation.
  Chance of dying from stroke doubles from the least to the most deprived deciles.
  
analysis_bysimd/Num mortalities per hospital discharge by quintile
  Highest ratio of deaths:hospital discharge actually occurs in the 4th quintile, or the 2nd least dperived quintile.

analysis_bysimd/Mortalities by age group and SIMD
  Mortality is higher for those in the most deprived decile.
  SIMD has the highest impact on mortality for the under 65 age group. 
  189.5 people per 100,000 under 65 (adjusted) die of strokes in the most deprived decile, compared to just 42.3 of those in the least deprived decile.
