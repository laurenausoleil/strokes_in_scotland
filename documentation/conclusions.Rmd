What is the most common stroke diagnosis in Scotland?
analysis_q1_q2/Average rates for hospital stays, discharges and deaths by healthboard 
----

CD is the most common diagnosis, measured by EASR of hospital discharges, with 479 per 100,000. Followed by Stroke (332), TIAs(64) and SH (19).

----
Are there any differences when we look at the data by health board vs by local authority?
analysis_q1_q2/difference in stay rates
analysis_q1_q2/difference in mortalities
analysis_q1_q2/difference in discharges
----

No significant differences. Greatest difference is in discharges rates in Glasgow with a difference of 30 discharges per 100,000 population.

----
Are there any differences in stroke metrics between different demographics (e.g. sex, age group)?

# Gender
analysis_bydemographic/gender/diagnosis
  Women die from SH proportionally more than men.
  
analysis_bydemographic/gender/incidence
  Men have higher rates of incidence than women and other genders
  
analysis_bydemographic/gender/gender incidence over time
With mean:
  All groups trending in decrease, with female incidence rates being the most volatile.
  Female incidents rising since 2016, all genders slightly increasing since 2016.
With median: 
  Most significant decrease in 2010, then no significant change. 
  Fluctuation 2010-2014, stasis or increase 2014-2018.
  
analysis_bydemographic/gender/Gender mortality over time
  Mortalities for male have outstripped females in 2013, 2016 and 2018.
  All mortality rates declining.
  Mortality rates for the most recent figures showed male with highest mortalities
  
# Age

analysis_bydemographic/age/mortality
  Most deaths in 75 plus age group (435 deaths per 100,000 EASR), followed by 65-74 group (57), 45-64 (11) then 0-44 (1).
  
analysis_bydemographic/age/Trends in age group diagnoses over time/mortality
  No upwards trends in mortality by stroke.
  Mortality has decreased significantly for the over 75 group and remained static for all other age groups.
  
analysis_bydemographic/age/diagnosis/mortality
  Stroke accounts for consistent proportion of mortalities across all age groups.
  CD is the highest killer for all age groups and proportion of death by CD increases with age.
  Proportion of death by SH decreases with age group.
  
analysis_bydemographic/age/diagnosis/discharges
  Stroke discharges increase with age group.
  CD is the most common diagnosis and accounts for consistent proportion of discharges across all age groups.
  Proportion of SH hospital activity decreases with age group
  
Combined
  Although we see more hospital activity for stroke as age group increase, we do not see the proportion of deaths by stroke increasing.
  Although proportion of hospital activity for CD is consistent across age groups, it accounts for a higher proportion of mortalities for older age groups. i.e CD appears to be more fatal for older groups.
  SH is affecting and killing younger age groups more than older age groups.
  
analysis_bydemographic/age/diagnosis/Ratio activity to deaths
  Percentage of deaths by hospital activity increases with age group.
  SH is the most fatal diagnosis for all groups under 75 years.
  Death by stroke does not increase as significantly for stroke diagnosis in the 75 plus age group as it does for all other age groups.
  
analysis_bydemographic/age/diagnosis/Mortality by age and diagnosis over time
  We see decrease in mortalities for the 75 plus age group with CD and stroke, but not SH. All other age groups have consistent mortality rates for all diagnoses.
